# Classification
In this repo I achieved some machine learning algorithms: KNN, PCA, Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, Backpropagation algorithms and so on (no using any library such as sklearn). Languages I used are Matlab and Python.

- In Assignment1 I achieved PCA, linear and a quadratic decision boundary(LDA, QDA) models, which applied in number image classification.
- In Assignment2 I achieved logistic regression and back-propagation algorithm of neural network, which applied in face classification.
- In Assgnment3 I achieved three cross validation methods and two types of SVM.
   Three cross validation methods : leave-one-out cross-validation(Loo), k-fold cross-validation(CV), . 
   Two types of SVM: hard-margin SVM and soft margine SVM
** Language of Assignments: Matlab

- Data challenge -- use CNN to classify mnist fashion dataset
- For the rest you can tell from file name.
** Language of the others: Python
