# Classification
In this repo I implemented machine learning algorithms: KNN, PCA, Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, Backpropagation algorithms and so on (without using any library such as sklearn). Languages I used are matlab and python.

- In A1 I wrote raw code of PCA, linear and a quadratic decision boundary(LDA, QDA) models, which applied in number image classification
- In A2 I wrote raw code of logistic regression and back-propagation algorithm of neural network, which applied in face classification. And also there are some mathematical derivation questions in A2.
- A3 is about RBF network and SVM
- data challenge -- use CNN to classify mnist fashion dataset
